                <h2>10 major reasons to travel to the mountains</h2>
                <h4>1. Altitude, appetite, and weight loss</h4>
                <p>Mountains provide high altitudes, and high elevation decreases appetite making you feel fuller sooner. It can directly lead to weight loss. Recent research carried out in Germany confirmed this result. The researchers took 20-middle aged obese men in the mountains and let them stay there for a week without restricting their food habits. By the end of the week, these obese men were found to have shed some pounds. So, staying in high altitudes is a lazy way to control your weight. </p>
                <h4>2. Stay in shape</h4>
                <p>Do you get tired and out of breath after climbing a few stairs? If so, you should consider traveling to the mountains. Hiking helps you burn your extra fat easily. You can burn some calories at the gym, but it requires a lot of determination. In contrast, the fantastic views of mountains provide an incentive for you to trek some more. Hence, it is a fabulous idea to travel to the mountain regions to remain in shape. </p>

As you spend time together, tackle the paths, or enjoy the sceneries, you will create a shared experience, which ultimately makes your relationship more cordial and stronger. </p>
